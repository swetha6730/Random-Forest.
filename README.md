# Random-Forest.
# Project Title :Classify the Random_Forest algorithm using skit.learn classifier "RandomForestClassifier" for iris.csv, and pedict the data how many species are interconnected with nth Decision tree node.
# Task-1 :Import the RandomForestClassifier by using sklearn.ensemble library.
# Task-2 :Load your data using seaborn graphics library as arguement load_iris().
# Task-3 :Preprocess the data using skitlearn graphics library.
# Task-4 :Select the model using "model_selection" from sns as a seaborn and sklearn as a skitlearn machine learning library.
# Task-5 :Load iris.csv dataset for data as a input variable and target as the functionable output variable.
# Task-6 :Pick the train and test data using arguemental library train_test_split.
# Task-7 :Select the estimators as the nth Decision tree.
# Task-8 :Use a RandomForestClassifier and fit your model.
# Task-9 :Find out your accuracy model.
# import libraries
# Load the Iris dataset
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
# Create a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees
# Train the classifier on the training data

# Make predictions on the test data
# Calculate accuracy

# Conclusion :My model has approach 1.00 accuracy, which is lies between in the range of 0 to 1.
Hence it is shows that RandomForestDecision model successfully implement.
